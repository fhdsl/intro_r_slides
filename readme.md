# How to Use this Project

## For each week

- [] Click into the week folder and open up the `.RProj` file in there.
  - For example, for `week1` I will open the `week1/week1.Rproj`
- [] Open up the classwork or exercise folder and save a copy of the classwork and exercise files with your name
  - For Example, for `week1/exercise1.qmd`, save a copy as "week1/exercise1-laderas.qmd" 

## To Update

- Make sure that you have saved a copy of your exercises with your name on it. In general, we won't overwrite exercises, but it is a possibility.
- In the `Terminal` tab (not `Console`), execute the following command:

```
git pull
```

If you feel less comfortable with that, you can use the `pull` button in the Git Tab in the upper right window.
